<h1>Random Hero Image on refresh</h1>

<p>On a website I was developing, I wanted to have a random "Hero" image displayed each time the page was refreshed. What I thought would be a simple solution turned out to be a little more involved than I thought. Here is my solution! </p>

<br>

<ul>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>I put the function inside the HTML, but it could easily be moved to a external file. An array of images is created, and then called randomly and displayed to the specified class, easy peasy<p>
